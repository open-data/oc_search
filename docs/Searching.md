Searches normally require all search terms to be present. Additionally,
searches can be refined using _Boolean_ operators. These are special words that
expand or narrow search results, including:

  - *AND / ET*: Include results that contain both keywords.
  - *OR / OU*: Include results that contain either keyword.
  - *NOT / PAS*: Exclude results that contain the keyward that follows
  - *"" Quotation Marks*: Include results that exactly match the quoted phrase
  - *() Parenthesis*: Group together search terms and control the order in which terms will be searched.
  - *\* Asterisk*: Include results that contain a variation of words. Note that the asterisk only works at the end of a word

Please note that search results automatically include some words which
are related. For example, the search term `run` will return results that include
`running` and `runs`

*Examples*:

  - `water AND air`
  - `water OR air`
  - `water NOT sea`
  - `"Water Quality Objectives"`
  - `quality AND (water OR air)`
  - `Financ*`

  - `eau ET riviere`
  - `eau OU riviere`
  - `eau PAS riviere`
  - `eau ET (riviere OU ocean)`
  - `"qualité de léau"`
  - `oceano*`

_Please note that Boolean keywords are case-sensitive and must be capitalized_
