The "More like this" results in the Open Data search had been reformatted to work
with CKAN's dataset page. This returns just a basic HTML list. Search has been
updated so then when users click on this link in the Open Data search results page
they are shown the Search app's default well formatted More-like-this results page.
CKAN will continue to receive the expected basic list.
